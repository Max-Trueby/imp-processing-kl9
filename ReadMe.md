  0. If we meet some day, and you think
this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return
  1. Acknowledge the original author by mentioning my name. Enjoy your journey of discovery and learning!
  2. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be mean.
     Being mean includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:
  1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
   1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being mean.
   1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER mean guy.
  3. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a mean guy would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) a pint.
