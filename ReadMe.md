  1. If we meet some day, and you think
this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return
  2. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be mean.
     Being mean includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:
  1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
   1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being mean.
   1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER mean guy.
  3. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a mean guy would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) a pint.
  3. The author encourages students and schools to freely use the Code for learning purposes and without any restrictions. You are welcome to explore, study, and gain knowledge from it. Feel free to modify, merge, publish, distribute, and sublicense Code. The only requirement is to acknowledge the original author by mentioning my name. Enjoy your journey of discovery and learning!
